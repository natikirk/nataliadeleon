                <p>I'm an experimental architect from Venezuela based in Berlin.</p>
                <p>My practice drifts in between art, programing & design, exploring morphologies as generative &
                    adaptive
                    concepts, where the line between humans, machines, and codes begin to blur.</p>
                <p>I specialized in creative technology, computational design, 3d printers and digital fabrication.</p>
                <p>I'm curious, playful and inquisitive collaborative, with a keen eye for design and development.</p>
